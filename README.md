# Project Overview
This project analyzes sales performance using SQL queries and Power BI dashboards.
The goal is to understand revenue trends, customer behavior, product performance, and operational metrics such as return rates and transaction volumes.
The analysis supports data-driven decision making by highlighting key insights across weekly revenue, VIP contribution, discount effectiveness, and overall revenue.

Run SQL Queries
•	Open the sql folder
•	Execute .sql files in the following recommended order:
1.	Total Revenue.sql
2.	total cost.sql
3.	margin percentage.sql
4.	top 5 stores.sql
5.	Sales Channel Analysis.sql
6.	Customer Segmentation.sql
7.	Discount Performance.sql
8.	Weekly Sales Trends.sql
9.	wow.sql

11.	Top Products.sql
12.	Returns Analysis.sql

# Query tool:
•	PostgreSQL

# Power BI Dashboard
•	Open "C:\Users\bola\Desktop\mc_projectdashboard.pdf"
•	All visuals (weekly revenue, VIP revenue share, discount %, gross margin) update automatically

# Key Findings
 1. Weekly Revenue Trend
-- Sales show fluctuating demand with clear peaks during promotional periods and dips during off-season weeks.
2. VIP Customers Drive Disproportionate Revenue
-- VIP customers contribute a significantly 16% share of total revenue relative to their transaction count.
3. Gross Margin Performance
-- Gross margin remains healthy, with high-margin products contributing 49% to profitability.
4. Return Rates Are Low and Stable
-- The return rate is minimal with 1%, indicating strong product satisfaction and low operational waste.
5. Discount Strategy Impacts Revenue
-- Average discount of 11%. Higher discount periods correlate with short-term spikes in sales volume but lower per-unit profitability.
